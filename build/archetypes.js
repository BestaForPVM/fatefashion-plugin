    name: "Sister",
    description: "She orients to the beautiful. Her clothing expresses sexuality and invitation.",
    lightside: "She tends to compare herself to others; thus she might be correcting her image endlessly. Comparisons with others bring about a sense of superiority and inferiority at the same time. Usually, she will not accept a partner for whom she has to make an effort. She is more likely to be a sister to him, rather than a partner. Perfecting her own image is not for the sake of masculine attention but in pursuit of an inner ideal. A man remains unaccepted at the level of feelings, which has a profound effect on her relationship with him. She yearns for attention in all possible ways. Her outfits are openly sexual, the skirts short, the cleavage deep, the pants tight and the colors bright - with high heels.",
    shadowside: "Her attitude on the physical side of the world, and especially of her body, is negative. This woman might be highly superstitious or even God-fearing. Nevertheless, she will torture her body with various diets or spend all her savings on improving her body shapes. However, at the same time, this will not provide her with security and will definitely not improve her relationships with men. This woman might appear quite vulgar.",

    name: "Hermit",
    description: "Noble and lonely, she is ever torturing herself in anguish to overcome the shadows of the past. Hers are the aesthetics of withering and professional success. She concentrates on her inner world and hides within her clothes as if she were in some inner castle. The designation of her clothing is not to emphasize the exceptional but to hide.",
    lightside: "The Hermit has separated from the world in lieu of finding a road within her, to concentrate on her inner life. Stones attract her, and she examines their energy and power. Her interest is in those areas of knowledge that require serious study. She joins the two poles within herself - deeply felt experiences and the highest level of knowledge. Thus she gains clarity, power and an ability to find agreement with herself. She serves her own creativity and experiences devotion. Her style is original and unique appearing as though she were trying to wrap herself into one or another cocoon. Black, asymmetrical lines, sparse accessories and stones predominate.",
    shadowside: "She runs away from society driven by her fears. She refuses help and shuts herself off into a world of her own making, which could be filled up with heroic feats of the past, anger over lost popularity or the fear of aging. Her selection in clothing tends to the baggy and disorderly.",

  {
    name: "Ruler",
    description: "Her cold aristocracy couples with sophisticated elegance. She has a subtle, exacted taste. This serves as an example to all imitators that this is a desirable ideal to pursue. Her style is immaculate and most elegant.",
    lightside: "She radiates a vital energy and royal femininity. Hers is a governing power generating an atmosphere in which all people are able to develop their own potential freely. This woman knows how to upkeep orderliness in a household, in a country and in the world. This is so each one of her subordinates, whom she considers her children, would be calm, satisfied and happy. She takes great care about her apparel, which is a significant part of her status and image. She understands perfectly just how strongly clothing ingrains her status. Therefore, her dress is elegant and flawless anywhere at any time. She selects natural, expensive fabrics with a concise cut in harmonious colors. Her clothing emphasizes rather than overwhelms her beauty. Jewelry is used with reservation. Her demeanor is always regal and kept up with perfection.",
    shadowside: "She is inclined towards tyranny. It is not only that her own life flows within a framework of strict rules, but she forces others to live in a \"cage\" as well. She controls with petty demands. A huge number of responsibilities can steal the joy out of life. She becomes arrogant, whenever her governing, power or influence is under dispute. Not a speck of dust can be on her clothing. Her mode of dress is especially ceremonious, closed off and constraining, emphasizing her strictness. The apparel is akin to being imprisoned.",

    name: "Teacher",
    description: "She engages in passing information to others. Her style values practicality and functionalism.", lightside: "Her patience provides her with an ability to wait and observe slow growth. She has the capability of transmitting information, experience and wisdom in an easy and attractive form. This is a smart and well-educated woman. She provides an example of how long-term, consistent growth both personally and within one’s activities can provide satisfaction with one’s work and its results. Her dress is reserved, because she values practicality and functionalism - comfortable clothing along with a roomy handbag.", shadowside: "She could be manipulating or abusing her students. She always knows what’s best and what’s bad. Intolerance of mistakes made by others is possible.", image: Ze

  { name: "Airhead", description: "Easygoing and naive, this woman is sensitive and overwhelmingly charming. Gentlemen choose naive gigglers so, along their side, they can become heroes. Her hair is generally long, whereas her dresses do not cover her knees. Her favorite color is a pinkish red hue. She adores high-heeled shoes.", lightside: "She looks at life with wide-open eyes. Spontaneity and unpredictability are part of her zest for life. She lays bare her emotions fearlessly, seemingly carelessly and heads for the unknown, mysterious and unexpected. Plato said all acquaintances start from wonderment, something she has in capacity. She helps people laugh at the absurdity and hypocrisy. Her simplicity charms everyone. This woman knows how to emphasize her sexuality; she does not fear prying eyes. Her figure is gorgeous, and she displays it gracefully as she flirts with the world.", shadowside: "Carelessness, confusion and disorderliness are her features. Her infantilism comes with all its signs - frivolity, innocence, fervor and, quite often, dumbness. Her outlook on her own life and that of other people tends to be inconsiderate. However, she denies negative emotions. Naivety appears in her style, the same as in her life. She likes clothes with infantile elements - pinks are in surplus. She wears ruffles and frills and especially short dresses without consideration of her age.", image: Xe }, { name: "Student", description: "She has a brazen innocence and is eternally in pursuit. Her capabilities include grasping, accepting and incorporating new information. This young woman is a chameleon who readily adapts to circumstances. Her style reflects gentleness and childishness cunningly intermingled. Dresses and skirts come short. The silhouette is skintight; viewed one way, it can appear modest but another way - seductive.", lightside: "This curious woman is full of ideas and plans that contradict one another. She may be intelligent and rational, but her goals are most unstable. Her talent is in associating and making alliances with each and everyone who happen along the way. Relationships tend to be free or rationally oriented. Learning is utilized as a form for taking root in life, so she is open to lifelong learning. She is very strong because she is completely free of entrenched principles. Regret and repentance are foreign to her, and she has no interest in the fate of any former 'partner'. Her clothing emphasizes sexuality and deception.", shadowside: "Instability is a mark. These women readily lead older men astray, since their external environments have tremendous power. She tends to make short-term decisions. She can fall victim to self-deceptive emotions. Nonetheless, her purpose seems positive - rejecting emotional ties in order to resolve materialistic problems. She foot-drags when it comes to turning knowledge into action. Apparel is her key to search for a supporter.", image: et }, { name: "Beauty in the Tower", description: "A female is a riddle offering a man a chance to impress her and win her over. Her clothing is reminiscent of Victorian times. Her cleavage up to her neck is covered. She is the embodiment of the beautiful woman with a broken heart.", lightside: "She inspires others to await suitable moments for changes. Her teaching involves seeing a much deeper level of achievement. This provides a chance, especially for men, to sense their own strength and rely on themselves. She prefers the adornment of long hair. Her style is romantic, so she can wear gowns below the knees. Her dresses come with frills of different sorts, flared or pleated, with a standing collar or a jabot, maybe even a tie added.", shadowside: "She awaits a knight. Romantic illusions have infected her, which give her hope that dreams will come true in the future. All that’s necessary is to wait passively. Should a knight show up in her life, she would gaze upon him as if from a 'tower'. This is the reason her priority pick in clothing will have a 'scent' of olden times; these serve as her tower. This woman ignores attention from someone who is truly in love with her as she waits for the 'knight' of her fantasies.", image: tt }, { name: "Virgin", description: "She is the vision of innocence, devoid of any sins, and a dreamer. Her apparel is feminine including long skirts, as a rule. These are bright in fresh pinkish hues.", lightside: "She hides from the real world in her daydreams and her memories and lives in a world of her own imaginings, usually one meant for childhood. Her fantasies are naive and, sometimes, colored with strong tones of religiosity. As a daydreamer, she spends her time torturing herself with one main doubt, 'What if?' She imagines that everything will be all right, easy and simple, so she takes no risks. She upholds a symbolic cleanliness of her heart and soul. The style of dress is somewhat childish and doll-like consisting of closed, lengthened dresses, a silhouette with a slim waistline and gentle colors.", shadowside: "Dreams, dreams and nothing but daydreams are her mode. She feels lost, crossed out of the list of participants in the 'games of great love'. Intimacy is something she fears greatly. Her manner of dress is infantile - it’s her effort to run away from herself, from the adult world and from hardships.", image: at }, { name: "Fortune Hunter", description: "Sexuality, sensitivity and a challenge are her markers. She displays sexuality and courage in her dress. Her figure tends to be expressive, and she displays it with pleasure. Her hair is long. She wears high heels.", lightside: "This is an emancipated woman, an individualist. She is smart, independent and inventive with a fabulous imagination. She is capable of thoughtfully resolving personal problems. Her mental abilities free her from material dependence. However, a cold calculating woman hides behind her outer attractiveness. Her motives are transparent, and her behavior, predictable. It helps looking at relationships 'from afar' to understand what causes anxiety. Graceful movements make her a wonderful dancer. Her style is feminine, sexy and open. Streamlining her silhouette is a way to display her figure. She selects dresses and skirts to wear. Her lovely figure is very feminine. The application of makeup is excellent. She takes care of herself. Her lips are sensitive.", shadowside: "She can be vicious in her relationships, cunning, deceitful and unreliable. Since her beauty and attractiveness are superficial, she can be highly dangerous. By double-dealing, she manipulates others. She can break off a relationship without hesitation whenever some situation no longer satisfies her or whenever she is offered something better. There is a certain coldness in her relationships. She expresses herself with a subtle and even a biting irony. Her clothing gives off clear and rather straightforward sexual signals: low cut dresses/blouses, slit skirts and bared arms, shoulders and legs.", image: it }, { name: "Victim", description: "Life gets provoked causing pain and even for forced violence, which come to pass rather often. Her dress may be overly sexy and provocative. She chooses nearly see-through materials and tightly fitting clothes. An ideal figure has great meaning for her.", lightside: "She is the one who helps something that has been long hidden or repressed to become reborn and liberated. This proves to be the manifestation of a true beginning. She liberates herself from a harmful individual, from 'needless' features like shyness, fearfulness or such. She will protect you from the temptation of making a victim of yourself and encourage you to take responsibility for your own life. The shadowy side of our personalities, which we had not even considered previously, will open up by her guidance. The choice of apparel will be courageous. She likes the sorts of dresses that call for attention, so she watches her body, and has no fear of demonstrating it.", shadowside: "Hopelessness and fear cause her endless complaints. She plays the part of the victim to gain more attention and to call forth pity. She is incapable of defending her personal boundaries. She dresses in a way that shows off too much or is too short, which will prove sexually provocative.", image: st }, { name: "Hustler", description: "The essence is living through experiences. There are no boundaries, limitations or responsibilities. The image is bright, carefree and sexy. Her figure is of utmost importance. Dresses are short. She wears high heels and vivid makeup.", lightside: "A match is made between artistry and the needs of the market. She is inclined to take risks, to be brave. Alienation almost always accompanies personal relationships or their basis is merely self-interest. It is akin to a light reflecting playfully on the surface of water but never penetrating within it. Her behavior is loose. She provides other women with courage and teaches them to survive unfavorable circumstances. It’s as if she were asking - what price are you ready to pay for security while in captivity? Her style is so sexy it challenges an onlooker. Her long hair is worn loose and her clothing, form fitting. She shows off her cleavage with a deep cut. The colors are bright.", shadowside: "She stumbles into dependencies on men. Her own interests are most important to her, and whatever is useful to her is right. Her relationships are carefree and immature. She has no desire to be responsible. Contacts are superficial. There is an internal nervousness. She opts for material values and security over and above self-reliance. She has a vulgar, overly open style: her underwear could be 'accidentally' visible and her skirts too short. She wears high heels of high platform shoes.", image: nt }, { name: "Amuser", description: "Innocence and sin - disobedience and insolence mix in with the infantile. Innocence in clothing matches up with sexual provocation: knee-high socks, leg warmers or skintight stockings with mama's high heels, a light dress and lace tights.", lightside: "Her behavior is very easy going, filled with flirtations and empty promises. Happenings seem unreal with an illusionary comprehension. This woman is ready to follow her intuition, even when others have serious doubts. Childish outfits and miniskirts fill up her wardrobe. She has an A-type silhouette and includes lingerie elements in her apparel, such as lace, crocheted items and hair ribbons. Her wardrobe is a match of childish and sexy pieces.", shadowside: "She relies on success, not on hard work. Love is not directed at a person but rather at an imaginary person, at status and image. Her clothing is infantile, openly mini by form, puffed-up sleeves and ruffles, even when she is over 40 years of age.", image: rt }, { name: "Addict", description: "This is a sensitive, vulnerable woman filled with doubts. Clothing is meant for comfort. The fabrics must be natural and soft.", lightside: "She reacts to opinions of others so sensitively that she has nearly no energy left to act on her own. Very often unnecessary attachments that are harmful to her tie her down. She is quick to spot addictions and offer help to resist them. Her style encompasses naturalness, femininity and gentleness. Fabrics must be pleasant to the touch, like cashmere and silk. She embodies a sexy oversize and wears lingerie style displaying bared parts. Footwear is meant for comfort.", shadowside: "A lack of self-confidence diminishes her self-respect; therefore sadness hits her. A lack of success and emptiness define her. She’s digging her own grave by rejecting something of special value merely for the sake of salvaging relationships, which are ailing as it is. She allows dependency to dominate over and above her spiritual needs. Clothing serves as a hideaway.", image: ot }, { name: "Dilettante", description: "This upstart is provocative and anxiety ridden. Apparel is conceptual, and she wears what is non-standard. Few understand her. She has her own understanding about what to wear and how to wear it.", lightside: "Quick-witted and active, this woman exudes self-confidence. There is an overflow of pure energy, which can have a positive as well as a negative effect. She tends to make use of scandals and conflicts to gain popularity for herself. She is a master at insinuations, behind the scenes intrigues and biting commentaries. Even when she lacks the necessary education, she finds pleasure in being active. She warns about a danger of becoming superficial. When it comes to material matters, she handles them practically, subtly, smartly and quickly. She is a clothing designer, which she either orders or sews on her own. Predominately the cuts and seams are open and asymmetrical, marked by eclecticism. An intellectual fashionista, she expresses her own meanings by her apparel.", shadowside: "She is overly irritating, since she tends to be harmful and ill-willed. She tries to show off about having much deeper knowledge of matters than she does in truth. Friendship might be feigned, so long as this satisfies her interests. Her style is that of a beginning designer. There are pretenses but little style - it’s kitsch.", image: lt }, { name: "Messiah", description: "She loves herself along with life itself. The choice of her clothing is for demonstrating her figure, since she is convinced of her own desirability. She wears loud accessories, expressive makeup and high heels.", lightside: "She delights in life. Her sincerity shines in confidence of the future. Everything is done seemingly with the heart of a child. She is wise in her innocence and simplicity. Action gives her joy, and she acts enthusiastically and successfully. She might be the soul of a team. Her assistance to others comes happily and unselfishly. The help she provides does not relate to some sort of effort to run away from oneself, something so characteristic of people who like to sacrifice themselves in behalf of others. Boldly she carries around what she likes, which is usually the kinds of clothes that show off her figure and barelegged in high heels. Dresses and skirts take priority.", shadowside: "The exaggerated naïveté can bring around childish behavior. There is overconfidence in the belief that she is the only one whose help to you has a chance of winning. Despite the position she might hold or the seriousness of an event, she just might wear clothing unsuitable for the occasion, age or job position. Don’t be surprised if she arrives at a funeral wearing a mini skirt.", image: ht }, { name: "Visionary", description: "A tremendous emotional satisfaction comes from always feeling one's individual stroke and original taste in clothing.", lightside: "This woman is sensitive to creative inspiration. She has the gift of perception coming from her inner being. Since she can grasp the essence of understanding, she doesn’t even try to understand with her mind. Her comprehension is healthy, in harmony with the pulse of life itself. Her movements go from the known into the unknown. She is able to foretell, what others are yet unable to see. Pronouncing a vision, without expecting personal benefit, is her tendency. She is the one to help resolve problems that seemed insurmountable for a long time. The air she breathes is that of youthful maximalism. This is exactly what serves her in overcoming that which others were unable to do. She selects an exceptional style for herself so she always stands out in a crowd. Her femininity shines through all her images. Her use of accessories is smartly creative. God resides in the details, she proclaims.", shadowside: "There is the emotional disappointment. She can end up misunderstood and feel lonely. Making fun of her, others have left deep scars. She may be smiling on the outside but weeping inside. Fear interferes with self-expression. She listens to the opinions of others too much, thereby marring her own creativity.", image: ct }, { name: "Sister", description: "She orients to the beautiful. Her clothing expresses sexuality and invitation.", lightside: "She tends to compare herself to others; thus she might be correcting her image endlessly.
